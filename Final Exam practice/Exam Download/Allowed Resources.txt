Exam Format
There are two parts to the exam. Part I is required and Part II is optional. Both will be completed on PIC machines. (No laptops allowed.)
Part I tests Track A/B material from the latter part of the course. For this part, you will get to choose one from six options (three corresponding with each track). Typically, these prompts ask you to complete one relatively long, multi-part objective. 
If you are not confident about your performance on Part I, you may complete one or more options from Part II, which test common material from the first part of the course. Typically, these options are shorter than those in Part I or are composed of several unrelated, very short questions.
Some of these options will require the use of Jupyter Notebook. You are allowed to prepare your solutions in whatever program you wish, but you might be required to submit your solution in a Jupyter Notebook with specific formatting instructions. 
A weighted average of your scores for Part I and Part II will be used to calculate your final exam score.

Allowed Resources
I intend for the exam to assess how you would typically perform in a real-world problem solving scenario, which is why you will have access to many resources. The Internet is a big place, so sometimes in practice you can even find a relatively complete solution that you can copy, paste, and hack to meet your needs. This is not the case in general, however, so it would not be a realistic simulation if you could access partial or complete solutions online during the exam. While I have done my best to generate original problems, I also try to make them simple and interesting, which makes it more likely that they have been considered before. Therefore, I must place some restrictions on Internet use to eliminate the possibility of finding unrealistic help online.

The following are allowed resources. If there is a resource that is not on this list that you think should be, let me know. (This document may be updated without notice before the exam.) If you get completely stuck during the exam and think you need another reference, ask and I'll consider the request. 

Any of your work for the course 
(Note: I suppose this includes course notes, so these are not really limited as I might have said before.)
